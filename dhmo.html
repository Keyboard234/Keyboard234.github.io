    <h1>DHMO: THE SILENT, INVISIBLE KILLER</h1>
    <h3>What is DHMO?</h3>
    <p>DHMO, also known as Dihydrogen Monoxide, is a nearly colorless, odorless, corrosive liquid. It kills <strong>THOUSANDS</strong> of people every year. It causes severe burns when in contact with its solid or gasous form, and is the main cause of suffocation, when people accidentally inhale the dangerous chemical.<br></p>
    <h3>What happens when you ingest DHMO?</h3>
    <p>Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include <strong>exessive sweating, urination, a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting, and body electrolyte imabalance.</strong> For people who are dependent on this chemical, withdrawal means certain <i>death.</i></p>
