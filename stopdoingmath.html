	 <center><h1>STOP DOING MATH</h1></center>
	 <center><li>NUMBERS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN NAMES</li></center>
	 <center><li>YEARS OF COUNTING yet NO REAL-WORLD USE FOUND for going higher than your FINGERS</li></center>
	 <center><li>Wanted to go higher anyway for a laugh? We had a tool for that: it was called "GUESSING"</li></center>
	 <center><li>"Yes please give me ZERO of something. Please give me INFINITY of it" - Statements dreamed up by the utterly Deranged</li></center>
	 <center><p>LOOK at what Mathematicians have been demanding your Respect for all this time, with all the calulators & abacus we built for them<br><strong>(This is REAL Math, done by REAL Mathematicians):</strong></p></center>
